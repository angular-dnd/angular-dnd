import { DragSourceMonitor } from './source-monitor';

/*
Note that you can't infer Item if you supply both beginDrag and endDrag,
since endDrag needs to find some type to put in the 'monitor' argument.
But people can always nail it down with `dnd.dragSource<MyItemType>('BOX', { ...spec })`.

/** The spec passed to {@link AngularDndService#dragSource}.
 *
 * Note the two type parameters. Both must represent plain JS objects.
 *
 * **`Item`** is the type you return from `beginDrag()`, and available in `monitor.getItem()`.
 * Limitations in TypeScript may prevent inferring this in many circumstances,
 * and it will default to `{}`. It is best if you are strong-typing to pass a
 * type parameter like so:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * interface MyDraggedItemType { id: number; }
 * // ...
 * source = this.dnd.dragSource<MyDraggedItemType>(..., {
 *     beginDrag: monitor => ({ id: this.id })
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * **`DropResult`** is the type you expect a drop target to return from `drop()`.
 * It is the type of the object returned by `monitor.getDropResult()` during `endDrag()`.
 * Note that your backend may assign some extra properties. You should define a
 * `DropResult` type that recognises these, such as:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * interface HTML5DropResult { dropEffect: string; }
 * interface MyDropResult extends HTML5DropResult { id: number; }
 * target = this.dnd.dropTarget<..., MyDropResult>(..., {
 *     drop: monitor => ({ id: this.id })
 * });
 *
 * source = this.dnd.dragSource<... MyDropResult>(..., {
 *     endDrag: monitor => {
 *         const result = monitor.getDropResult();
 *         if (result.dropEffect === 'copy') {
 *             // user had alt key pressed + the GreenPlus icon when they dropped,
 *             // so copy instead of move
 *         }
 *     }
 * });
 * ```

   * a plain JavaScript object describing the data being dragged. What you

   * drag source so it's important to pick the minimal data they need to know.
   * You may be tempted to put a reference to the component into it, but you
   * should try very hard to avoid doing this because it couples the drag
   * sources and drop targets. It's a good idea to return something like `{ id:
   * this.id }` from this method.

   *  "resurrected" with a different parent. For example, when moving a card
   *  across the lists in a Kanban board, you want it to retain the dragged
   *  appearanceâ€”even though technically, the component gets unmounted and
